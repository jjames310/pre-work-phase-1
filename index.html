     <h1> Pre-work Phase 1</h1>
     <p> Git is version control software on your computer.</p>
     <p> We COMMIT our code versions to git on our computer.</p>
     <p>Github.com is a cloud service that works with git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
     <p> We PUSH our code to github.com.</p>
     <p> We DEPLOY our projects to a server that the world can view them in a browser on a computer, tablet, or phone.</p>
     <p> In the bootcamp we DEPLOY to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu server</p>
     <h2> DEPLOY and PUSH are DIFFERENT!!!</h2>
